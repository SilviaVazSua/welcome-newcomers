Hello everyone! 

I'm Silvia. I'm from Spain :sunny: but currently I'm living in Vancouver, Canada :snowman:. 
I'm a computational linguist but I want to update my tech skills with this course .
I love **coffee**, **fruit** and **yoga** and I hate **noise**, **climate change** and **rude people**.

I'm enjoying a lot with this iniciative even though I don't have enough time to do everything! :anguished:

See you!!
